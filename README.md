A mobile web app for crowdsourcing caches of foragable goods in your neighbourhood. Get info on recent local finds and log your progress as a budding foragr.

Employs Ruby on Rails, Mapbox API, StimulusJS, and was built with the help of [Richard Young](https://github.com/frauzino) and [Vinh Tho](https://github.com/darkanzel)

*This app was built as part of my training at Le Wagon Web Development Bootcamp. Pins on the map do not represent real caches.*
